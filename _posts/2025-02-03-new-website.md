I've been working on a new website for a while now. It's a static site generated with Jekyll, hosted on GitHub Pages.
The site is built with a simple and clean design, focusing on content and readability.

The goal is to share my thoughts, projects, and experiences in software engineering. I'll write about personal projects,
open-source contributions, and insights from books, podcasts, and blogs. I'll also share slides and videos from tech
talks and conference presentations.

I hope you enjoy the content and find it useful. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or feedback. Thanks
for visiting!
